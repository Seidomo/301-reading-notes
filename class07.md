### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team


- Most teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others and teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. 

- A good team is different from bad is how teammates treated one another and every have a chance to talk and express their thoghts
as long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well.

- Its distinguished the good teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.

- * The take for me from this topic is that when working in a team environment it needs communication respecting your teamates
and expressing yourself and your emotions without the fear of judgement from your team members even
if it is a criticism, its how we deal with criticisms that makes a team a good one.

And everybody needs to talk their mind because being able to speak openly and freely to one another leads to more innovative ideas.
